# ETH AVAX DEGEN TOKEN IMPLEMENTATION

This is ETH AVAX Degen Token implementation.

## Description

This implementation fulfils the following requirements:

- Minting new tokens: The platform should be able to create new tokens and distribute them to players as rewards. Only the owner can mint tokens.
- Transferring tokens: Players should be able to transfer their tokens to others.
- Redeeming tokens: Players should be able to redeem their tokens for items in the in-game store.
- Checking token balance: Players should be able to check their token balance at any time.
- Burning tokens: Anyone should be able to burn tokens, that they own, that are no longer needed.

## KINDLY NOTE

The contract is deployed to sepolia due to the high gas fees on avalance and unavailability of AVAX Testnet Faucets.
I have AVAX testnet tokens, but it is insufficient to deploy the contract to the Avalance blockchain.

And I have two days till my time on this module expires. So I had to deploy to another EVM compatible blockchain.
But since Avalanche is EVM compatible, it should work the same way as it works on sepolia that I deployed to.
